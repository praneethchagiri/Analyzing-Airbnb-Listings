# Analyzing-Airbnb-Listings

**Data Source :**
The data for this project was sourced from Inside Airbnb, including datasets on listings, calendar availability, and customer reviews. The Listings Dataset contains detailed information on 391 listings across 18 attributes. The Calendar Dataset includes data on availability and pricing for 142,715 records, while the Reviews Dataset offers insights from 20,079 entries on customer feedback. Data cleaning involved removing rows with missing values, filling in missing numerical and categorical values, and converting price information to float format for analysis.

**Methodology :**
The project utilized comprehensive data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and advanced statistical techniques, including hypothesis testing and predictive modeling. EDA focused on price distributions, review patterns, and geographical listing distributions, while advanced analysis delved into pricing dynamics and consumer satisfaction. The methodology ensured robust analysis by focusing on data accuracy, pattern identification, and insight extraction from complex datasets.

**Results :**
Findings revealed significant trends in neighborhood popularity, price variability, and consumer preferences. Spatial analysis highlighted differences in pricing across neighborhoods, while temporal analysis showcased fluctuations in rental prices and availability. Sentiment analysis of reviews indicated overall positive guest experiences but varied across listings and neighborhoods. These results provide a nuanced view of Airbnb market dynamics.

**Visualizations :**
Visual representations included heatmaps for listings distribution, time-series plots for price trends, and sentiment polarity graphs from review data. These visualizations aided in understanding market patterns, pricing strategies, and consumer sentiment towards Airbnb listings.

**Implications :**
The project offers practical implications for Airbnb hosts in optimizing listings and pricing strategies. For travelers, it provides insights into choosing accommodations based on budget and location preferences. Additionally, the findings inform policymakers about the short-term rental market's impact on local housing dynamics.

**How to Use This Project :**
Instructions for replicating the analysis include requirements for software and data. The project utilized Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib for data manipulation and visualization. Users need to conduct data cleaning, perform EDA, and apply statistical methods to understand Airbnb market trends.

**Future Work :**
Suggestions for future research include deeper analysis into neighborhood desirability, the impact of amenities on pricing, and guest satisfaction factors. Incorporating advanced predictive modeling and machine learning could enhance understanding of market dynamics and customer behavior.
